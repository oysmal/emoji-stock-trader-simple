- **Configuration**: HOCON (application.conf)

## Development Process Instructions (COD Loop and sub-agents)

### CRITICAL: Clarify-Offer-Decide (COD) Loop Requirements

**You MUST follow this development workflow for ALL coding tasks:**

1. **CLARIFY Phase**

   - Ask clarifying questions about requirements before suggesting any code
   - Identify ambiguities in the request
   - Confirm understanding of the desired outcome
   - Ask about constraints, performance requirements, or preferences
   - Never assume implementation details without confirmation

2. **OFFER Phase**

   - Present 2-3 different approaches with pros/cons
   - Explain trade-offs for each option (performance, maintainability, complexity)
   - Include brief code sketches or pseudocode when helpful
   - Highlight any architectural implications
   - **DO NOT implement full solutions at this stage**

3. **DECIDE Phase**
   - **STOP and WAIT for the developer to choose an approach**
   - Do not proceed with implementation until explicitly directed
   - Respect that the developer is in the driver's seat
   - After a decision is made, implement only what was chosen

After the user DECIDES, if there exists a plan document you are working on,
write the a brief note about the decision to this plan document.

**Example COD Flow:**

```
Developer: "Call the emoji stock exchange API to get ðŸš€ stock price"
Claude: [CLARIFY] "I need to understand the API call details:
- What's the base URL for the emoji stock exchange?
- Do we need authentication for price data?
- Should this be a one-time call or recurring?
- What format does the API return (JSON, XML)?"

Developer: "https://api.emoji-exchange.com, no auth needed, recurring every minute"
Claude: [OFFER] "Here are three approaches:
1. Simple HTTP client with coroutine timer...
2. Scheduled background job with error handling...
3. WebSocket connection for real-time updates...
[explains each with trade-offs]
Which would you prefer?"

Developer: "Let's go with option 1"
Claude: [DECIDE -> IMPLEMENT] "Great! I'll implement update the implementation_plan.md and proceed with the HTTP client approach..."
```

### REQUIRED: Sub-Agent Workflow for Feature Development

**Follow this agent workflow for all feature development:**

**Important**: Always provide the user with information about what the sub-agent responded. If necessary, present everything verbatim.

1. **PLANNING**: Use `architecture-planner` agent to break down complex features into clear, manageable implementation steps
2. **IMPLEMENTATION**: Use appropriate Kotlin sub-agents:
   - `kotlin-service` - Business logic and services
   - `kotlin-ktor` - HTTP routes, API endpoints and configuration
   - `kotlin-db` - Database functionality, if needed
3. **REVIEW**: Use `kotlin-code-reviewer` agent to review all produced code for quality and best practices
4. **REFINEMENT**: If issues are found, pass back to appropriate `kotlin-*` agent to resolve
5. **VALIDATION**: Use `karen` agent to verify the plan was completed satisfactorily and all requirements met

**Example Workflow:**

```
Feature Request â†’ architecture-planner â†’ kotlin-service â†’ kotlin-code-reviewer â†’ (fixes if needed) â†’ karen
```

**CRITICAL SUB-AGENT INTERACTION RULE**: <instructions>
**YOU ARE NEVER ALLOWED TO ANSWER SUB-AGENT QUESTIONS YOURSELF**

When a sub-agent is in CLARIFY or OFFER phase:

- **FORBIDDEN**: Answering questions based on your interpretation of requirements
- **FORBIDDEN**: Making implementation decisions on the user's behalf
- **FORBIDDEN**: Filtering or summarizing sub-agent proposals
- **REQUIRED**: Surface ALL sub-agent questions/proposals verbatim to the user
- **REQUIRED**: Wait for explicit user DECIDE response before proceeding

**This applies to ALL questions from sub-agents:**

- User requirement clarifications
- Implementation detail questions
- Technical approach decisions
- Architecture choices
- Any other sub-agent questions

**The user must make ALL decisions. You are only the messenger.**
</instructions>

**Important 2**: <instructions>Make sure you always provide clear instructions to the sub-agent regarding when to stop and consider its task complete.</instructions>

This ensures features are properly planned, implemented with Kotlin best practices, reviewed for quality, and validated for completeness.

## Code Conventions

### Kotlin Style Guide

- Follow official Kotlin coding conventions
- Use `data class` for DTOs and value objects
- Prefer immutability: `val` over `var`
- Use sealed classes for representing restricted hierarchies
- Explicit return types for public functions
- Meaningful variable names, no abbreviations
- Max line length: 120 characters

### Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `UserService`, `AuthController`)
- **Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `getUserById`, `validateToken`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`)
- **Packages**: lowercase (e.g., `com.example.api.routes`)

### Ktor-Specific Conventions

- Route definitions in separate files under `/routes`
- Use extension functions for route configuration
- Implement proper error handling with StatusPages
- Use call.respond() with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Validate request bodies using kotlinx.serialization

## Project Structure

```
/src
  /main
    /kotlin
      /no.kraftlauget.kiworkshop
        /routes          # API route definitions (keep routes and handlers together)
        /services        # Functions etc. for business logic
        /models          # Data classes for domain entities and API models
        /utils           # Helper functions and utilities
        Application.kt   # Main application entry point
    /resources
      application.conf   # Ktor configuration
      logback.xml       # Logging configuration
      openapi          # OpenAPI specification files
/gradle
/build.gradle.kts
```

## Architecture Principles

- **Keep it simple**: Direct logic flow without unnecessary layers
- **No unnecessary layers**: Avoid overcomplicated pattern unless truly needed
- **Colocate related code**: Keep route handlers close to their route definitions
- **Prefer functions over classes**: Use top-level or extension functions when possible
- **Avoid premature abstraction**: Start concrete, abstract only when patterns emerge
- **Simplicity with reliability**: Simple code can still be robust - don't confuse simple with fragile

## Important Implementation Notes

### Error Handling

- Return simple, consistent error responses
- Throw standard exceptions (IllegalArgumentException, etc.) and handle in StatusPages
- Let exceptions bubble up to StatusPages rather than try-catch everywhere

## Environment Configuration

### Development Setup

```bash
# Required tools
- JDK 17+
- Gradle 8+

# Run locally
./gradlew run

# Build JAR
./gradlew shadowJar
```

### Environment Variables

```
# Server
SERVER_PORT=8080
SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0


# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

## Development Guidelines

- Write straightforward, readable code
- Use coroutines for async operations
- Add logging for important operations
- Validate inputs at the route level
- When implementing concurrent features, keep them simple but correct
- Atomic operations should use database transactions

## Security Requirements

- Simple header-based authentication
- Direct validation - no complex auth frameworks
- Fail fast with clear error messages

## Instructions for Claude

### When working on this project:

1. **ALWAYS follow the COD loop** - Never skip the Clarify and Offer phases
2. Ask for clarification on vague requirements before coding
3. Write simple, straightforward Kotlin code that works correctly
4. Prioritize readability over cleverness
5. Use coroutines for async operations
6. Keep code in the simplest structure that works
7. Include proper error handling
8. Add comments only for non-obvious logic
9. Use built-in Ktor features before adding libraries
10. Follow the established simple project structure
11. Validate inputs at the route level
12. Keep business logic close to where it's used
13. Avoid unnecessary abstractions and patterns
14. Simple doesn't mean incomplete - implement features fully but simply
