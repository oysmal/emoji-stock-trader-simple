# üöÄ Emoji Stock Exchange Workshop - Getting Started

## What You're Building

You'll create a trading bot that autonomously buys and sells emoji stocks (ü¶Ñ, üíé, ‚ù§Ô∏è, üçå, üçæ, üíª) to maximize profit. Your bot will compete against others in real-time on a live exchange.

## How the Exchange Works

- **Starting Position**: $10,000 cash + 100 shares of each emoji symbol
- **Goal**: Maximize your total equity (cash + stock value)
- **Trading**: Submit buy/sell limit orders via REST API
- **Competition**: Real-time leaderboard shows P&L rankings
- **Rate Limit**: 50 requests/second per team

### Order Book Mechanics

The exchange operates as a **central limit order book** with price-time priority:

- **Bids (Buy Orders)**: Sorted highest price first, then by time
- **Asks (Sell Orders)**: Sorted lowest price first, then by time  
- **Order Matching**: Incoming orders match against best opposite price
- **Spread**: Gap between best bid and best ask (e.g., bid $10.00, ask $10.50)

**Key Insight**: You buy at the **ask price**, sell at the **bid price**

### Order Book Example
```
Symbol: ü¶Ñ
Asks (Sellers):  $10.75 (50 shares)
                 $10.50 (100 shares)  ‚Üê Best Ask
                 ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
Bids (Buyers):   $10.00 (75 shares)   ‚Üê Best Bid
                 $9.75  (200 shares)
```

- To **buy immediately**: Submit market buy ‚Üí executes at $10.50
- To **sell immediately**: Submit market sell ‚Üí executes at $10.00
- **Spread cost**: $0.50 per share ($10.50 - $10.00)

## Workshop Tasks

### 1. üîå **Registration & Connection** (30 min)
- Register your team with a unique team ID
- Get your API key for authentication
- Test basic connectivity

### 2. üìä **Submit Your First Orders** (30 min)
- Learn order submission format
- Place buy and sell limit orders
- View orders in the order book

### 3. üíº **Track Your Portfolio** (30 min)
- Monitor cash and stock positions
- Track trade executions (fills)
- Calculate profit & loss

### 4. üéØ **Build a Simple Strategy** (30 min)
- Understand bid-ask spread mechanics
- Implement profitable trading logic
- Add position and cash management

**Strategy Fundamentals**:
- **Profitable Buy**: Place bid below current best ask
- **Profitable Sell**: Place ask above current best bid
- **Avoid Market Orders**: They execute immediately at worst price
- **Example**: If spread is $10.00-$10.50, place bid at $10.25, ask at $10.25

### 5. üè≠ **Detect Industrial Orders** (30 min)
- Spot large orders (quantity > 100) in the order book
- React quickly to guaranteed profit opportunities
- Compete for the best execution

**Industrial Order Detection**:
```bash
# Watch for large orders in order book
GET /v1/orderbook?symbol=ü¶Ñ

# Look for orderCount > 1 OR quantity > 100
{
  "asks": [
    {"price": 10.50, "quantity": 250, "orderCount": 1}  ‚Üê Industrial!
  ]
}
```

**Why Industrial Orders = Free Money**:
- Large order creates temporary price imbalance
- You can buy/sell against it at favorable price
- Other bots compete, so **speed matters**

## Success Tips

### Trading Strategy
- **Understand the spread** - Always know bid vs ask prices
- **Never market buy/sell** - Use limit orders to control price
- **Target the middle** - Place orders between bid and ask
- **Watch position limits** - Don't overexpose to one symbol

### Industrial Order Strategy  
- **Monitor order book depth** - Look for quantity > 100
- **React fast** - Other teams compete for same opportunities
- **Calculate profit first** - Ensure spread > transaction costs

### Development Tips
- **Start with manual testing** - Use Swagger UI first
- **Test your math** - Verify profit calculations
- **Check the leaderboard** - Track performance vs others
- **Handle rate limits** - 50 req/sec max

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ‚ùå Buying at ask, selling at bid (guarantees loss)
- ‚ùå Using market orders (worst execution price)
- ‚ùå Ignoring position limits (overconcentration risk)
- ‚ùå Not validating profit before placing orders
